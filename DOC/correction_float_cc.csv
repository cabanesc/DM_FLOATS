6902766;na;  linear drift ($\approx$ -0.0025/yr); ; No corretion; No correction; Salinities of this float seem very stable throughout all the cycles analysed. The correction proposed by the OWC run is a small linear trend that lies within the 0.01 instrument accuracy treshold. Not enough reference CTD data is available to obtain  reliable results using only CTD reference database. No correction is necessary for this float.
# 6902746;na; -0.001$\pm$ 0.002; ; No corretion; No correction; This float enters the Caribbean Sea at Cycle 74. The use of a mask was necessary to select the reference data belonging to the same geographical region as the float profile. In the Caribbean Sea, there are no reference data for $\theta$ below 5$^{\circ}$. Therefore, levels above 5$^{\circ}$ have been chosen for the calibration. The correction proposed by the OWC run is a small offset that lies within the 0.01 instrument accuracy treshold. Not enough reference CTD data is available to obtain  reliable results using only CTD reference database. No correction is necessary for this float.
6902746;na;salty  drift detected  from cycle 85 onwards; ;No correction up to cycle 84, flag 4 after;No correction up to cycle 84, flag 4 after; This float enters the Caribbean Sea at Cycle 74. The use of a mask was necessary to select the reference data belonging to the same geographical region as the float profile. In the Caribbean Sea, there are no reference data for $\theta$ below 4.5$^{\circ}$. Therefore, levels above 4.5$^{\circ}$ have been chosen for the calibration. OWC detects salty drift,  from cycle 85 onwards, but the onset of this drift is difficult to estimate as it would coincide with the time when the float enters the Caribbean Sea and little reference data is available on the deepest theta levels. A comparison with data from a very close float suggests an offset of +0.005 (Figure 4) at Cycle 77. We therefore decided not to correct the float until cycle 85 but to flag the salinity at 2 between cycle 60 and 85 (error larger tha 0.015). The salinity data after cycle 85 is flagged at 4 and the float is put on the grey list.
# 6902757;na; linear drift ($\approx$ -0.01/yr) after cycle 40 ; ;No corretion; No correction;  The correction proposed by the OWC run show a salty drift starting cycle 40. This is related to a decrease in reference salinities along the float path (maybe due to a lack of recent reference data?), which is not seen in float measurements. Indeed, the salinities measured by the float are very stable throughout all the cycles analysed. As of now, there is no evidence of a salty drift,  so we do not correct this float.

We decided to correct this float between cycle 43-94 using OWC correction. Salinity data is flag 4 from cycle 95 onwards, and the float is put on the grey list.

6902772;na;linear drift ($\approx$ -0.04/yr) after cycle 50; ; No corretion; No corretion;The correction proposed by the OWC run show a salty drift starting cycle 50. This is related to a decrease in reference salinities along the float path, which is not seen in float measurements (float trapped in an  eddy? see the loop path). The salinities measured by the float are very stable throughout all the cycles analysed.  As of now, there is no evidence of a salty drift, so we do not correct this float.

3901971;na;linear drift ($\approx$ 0.015/yr); ; No correction; No correction; We have chosen to calibrate using theta less than 4.5$^{\circ}$ because of large variability in reference data around 5$^{\circ}$.The small fresh drift found by OWC is not seen in the upper levels. As of now, there is no evidence of a fresh drift,  so we do not correct this float.
3901970;na;0.006 $\pm$ 0.014; ; No correction; No correction;  We have chosen to calibrate using theta larger than 12$^{\circ}$ because of large variability in the Mediterranean water layer and below. The correction proposed by the OWC run is a small offset that lies within the 0.01 instrument accuracy treshold. No correction is necessary for this float.
3901980;na;0.006 $\pm$ 0.025 and small drift; (1 break point) after cycle 25; No correction; No correction; We reduced latitude scales since the float is located in the equatorial Atlantic. We do not use the potential vorticity constraint when selecting profiles and reduce MAP\_P\_DELTA to 50db to prevent mixing levels with too different pressures (see theta/S shape). The first 25 profiles do not go deeper than 1000m (cycle time less than 1 day). The correction proposed by the OWC run lies within the 0.01 instrument accuracy treshold. No correction is necessary for this float.

We do not use the potential vorticity constraint when selecting profiles and reduce MAP\_P\_DELTA to 50db to prevent mixing levels with too different pressures (see theta/S shape). The correction proposed by the OWC run is a small linear trend that lies within the 0.01 instrument accuracy treshold. Very few recent data are available. As of now, there is no clear evidence of a salty drift or offset, so we do not correct this float, but a check in a few cycles is recommended.

3901954;na; linear drift ($\approx$ -0.024/yr) up to cycle 45; and strong drift afterward; OWC correction applied; OWC correction applied; We reduced latitude scales since the float is located in the equatorial Atlantic. We do not use the potential vorticity constraint when selecting profiles and reduce MAP\_P\_DELTA to 50db to prevent mixing levels with too different pressures (see theta/S shape). OWC detects a salty drift for this float, a stronger drift is starting after cycle 45. A comparison with a float close in space and time (float 1902180,cycle 69) at cycle 63, shows a salty offset (0.22). We decided to correct the salinity for the small drift up to cycle 45 and then flag salinity after cycle 46 (flag 4) because of the very large drift. Both reference Argo and CTD databases were used to compute the correction.

6902818;0.004;0.003 $\pm$ 0.0035 ;and linear drift after cycle 14;OWC correction applied; OWC correction applied (salty drift);The correction proposed by the OWC run shows that a salty drift ($\approx$ 0.037/yr) is starting cycle 14. There is no strong evidence of a depth-dependency. We decided to apply the correction proposed by OWC  until it reaches -0.05(and then apply a flag 4).
6902882;-0.001;-0.0024 $\pm$ 0.0036; ;No correction; No correction; OWC seems to suggest that a small fresh bias exists in the first ten cycles. This is not consistent with the comparison with the reference CTD cast and is probably related to the choice of reference data by the OWC software (both saltier profiles on the reykjanes ridge and cooler profiles towards the west). The reduction of map scales has helped to mitigate this bias. A small salty biais is seen overall but probably due to the reference data variability (see figure 6).

Figure 4 shows the comparison of cycles 9 and 59, which are close in space, the float trajectory making a loop. No difference in sigma0 is clearly visible for these two profiles.  We then applied a constant correction determined by the comparison with the reference CTD cast made at float launch (0.0033).

This is  consistent with the comparison with the reference CTD cast with cycle 2A (cycle 1D was partly flagued as bad and cycle 1A was flagued as bad). We then applied the OWC correction.
